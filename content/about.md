Welcome!
I am a fourth year graduate student at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) working in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](https://netneurolab.github.io).

My research focuses on developing and applying statistical techniques to high-dimensional neuroscience datasets.
In particular, I'm interested in assessing how methodological choices can impact statistical results generated by researchers.

I also have a passion for developing software that makes it easier for scientists to do their work.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmarkello) for some projects that I'm working on or drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism/) to chat!
