I am currently a data engineer at [1m](https://www.1mplatform.com), where I oversee all things data for our healthcare risk management platform.

I was previously at [Komodo Health](https://www.komodohealth.com/) and [Octave](https://www.octavebio.com/), where I worked on data pipelines for processing and analyzing healthcare data at scale.
I received my PhD in Neuroscience at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home).

In my spare time I've developed software designed to make doing research easier.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmarkello) for some projects that I've worked on or drop me a line on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rossmarkello) to chat!
