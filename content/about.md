Welcome!
I am a third year graduate student at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](https://www.netneurolab.github.io).

My research focuses on the application of statistical techniques to complex, high-dimensional datasets.
In particular, I'm interested in how we can use tools from network theory to better understand and predict the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on the brain.

I also have a passion for developing software that makes it easier for scientists to do their research.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmarkello) for some projects that I'm working on, or drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism/) to chat.
