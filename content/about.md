I am a data engineer at [Octave Biosciences](https://www.octavebio.com/) where I support infrastructure for processing and analyzing neuroimaging data from patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

I was previously a PhD candidate at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](https://netneurolab.github.io), where my work focused on understanding how methodological variability influences human brain mapping research.

In my spare time I've developed some software designed to make doing research easier.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmarkello) for some projects that I've worked on or drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism/) to chat!
