I am currently a data engineer at [Komodo Health](https://www.octavebio.com/) where I develop pipelines for processing and analyzing healthcare data at scale.

I was previously a data engineer at [Octave](https://www.octavebio.com/) where I created infrastructure to process neuroimaging data from patients with neurodegenerative disease. 
I received my PhD at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](https://netneurolab.github.io), where my work focused on understanding how methodological variability influences neuroimaging research.

In my spare time I've developed some software designed to make doing research easier.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmarkello) for some projects that I've worked on or drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism/) to chat!
