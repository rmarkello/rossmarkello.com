This past week we had the Montreal edition of [BrainHack Global](https://brainhackmtl.github.io/global2019/), which means I was holed up at Concordia University working around people hacking on some [really](https://twitter.com/BrainhackMTL/status/1203080732140281856) [cool](https://twitter.com/BrainhackMTL/status/1203061017657401344) [projects](https://twitter.com/BrainhackMTL/status/1203045643561918467).
We were also hosting a friend ([Dan Gale](https://danjgale.github.io/)) who was in town for the BrainHack so when we weren't at Concordia hacking we were out food-touring our way through Montreal.

Interspersed with the copious coding and eating I enjoyed reading some cool new (and, in some cases, not-so-new) papers, blog posts, and articles.
As always, this is an incomplete ("curated") list, but hopefully you find something worthwhile :smile:

## Preprint and papers

- Discovering Precise Temporal Patterns in Large-Scale Neural Recordings through Robust and Interpretable Time Warping ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.10.020)) by [Alex Williams](https://twitter.com/ItsNeuronal) and colleagues
- Two Distinct Neural Timescales for Predictive Speech Processing ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.10.019)) by [Peter Donhauser](https://twitter.com/pwdonh) and [Sylvain Baillet](https://twitter.com/sylvain_baillet)
- Open Data Metrics: Lighting the Fire ([link](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3525349)) by [Daniella Lowenberg](https://twitter.com/DaniLowenberg) and colleagues

(Note: For published works with five or more authors I am only listing the first author to (1) save myself from having to try and track down everyone's Twitter handles and (2) limit the "visual clutter" of having upwards of 50 links in a single bullet point.
Nonetheless, I acknowledge the hard work of all the authors for these fantastic pieces of work, and you should too!
Be sure to click the associated link for each bullet point to see the amazing team behind each.)

## Internet things

- [Gaël Varouquax](https://twitter.com/GaelVaroquaux)'s [short write-up](http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/getting-a-big-scientific-prize-for-open-source-software.html) on being part of the team that received the "Académie des Sciences Inria prize for transfer" for their work on [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- [Dan Simpson's](https://twitter.com/dan_p_simpson/) (self-reported) "[shitpost](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/12/02/unquestionable-research-practices/)" on how statistics can't fix bad models / hypotheses / data. (This actually serves as a fantastic summary of [Danielle Navarro's](https://twitter.com/djnavarro/) blog post on pre-registration from [my 2019-11-24 reading list]({{< ref "/posts/2019-11-24_reading-list.md#internet-things" >}})&mdash;which [she also acknowledges](https://twitter.com/djnavarro/status/1201564900117626881)!)
- The new documentation for the [Courtois NeuroMod project](http://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/2020-alpha/), which has its first scheduled data release in June of 2020. This is a lot of up-front work, but I think if everyone put in this amount of time and energy to creating documentation for their datasets the scientific ecosystem would be all the better for it.
- This [insightful retrospective](https://twitter.com/pierre_bellec/status/1203038496992223234) from [Pierre Bellec](https://twitter.com/pierre_bellec) on what he's learned over the past 10 years working on a "now-obsolete" processing pipeline ([NIAK](https://t.co/88MVWxN9jc?amp=1)). I'm copying below text from one of my favorite (i.e., most important) tweets in his thread:
    > "I did not know the difference between open-source and community-based software. I thought that after posting my code on the web, people would start contributing to it. But I made no effort to engage a community. So the community ended up being only my lab and collaborators."

## Just for fun

- This absolutely [hilarious article](https://www.thecut.com/2019/12/my-wifes-enemies-are-now-my-enemies-too.html) on how long-term relationships mean adopting all your partner's enemies. (via [@emdupre_](https://twitter.com/emdupre_))
- This really fun [interactive website](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/) on the deep sea by [@nealagarwall](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal)

While I initially started this reading list series as a means to fill up the empty blog section of my new website theme, over the past three weeks I've realized that it's already helped me (1) read a lot more, and (2) think a lot more about _what_ I'm reading.
This has highlighted how skewed the demographics of my reading list are (with this week as notably troublesome), so moving forward I'll be making a concerted effort to broaden my list to include more diverse authors.
