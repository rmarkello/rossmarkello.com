Since my new website theme has a blog section (that I felt compelled to try and fill with at least *some* content) I decided to start a semi-weekly compilation of things I'm reading / have read / intend to read and will pretend I've read if you ask.
(Note: this will serve mostly as a way for me to pat myself on the back at the end of each week for having accomplished *something*, even if it's not remotely what I was supposed to be doing.)

So, without further ado, here's most of what I've been reading this past ~week (in no particular order):

### Preprints and papers

- [The generalizability crisis](https://psyarxiv.com/jqw35) by [Tal Yarkoni](https://twitter.com/talyarkoni/)
- [The Flatland fallacy: Moving beyond low-dimensional thinking](https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12404) by [Eshin Jolly](https://twitter.com/Eshjolly) and [Luke Chang](https://twitter.com/lukejchang)
- [Fast lane to slow science](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.10.007) by [Uta Frith](https://twitter.com/utafrith)

### Internet things

- This [blog post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/11/13/what-if-its-never-decorative-gourd-season/) by [Dan Simpson](https://twitter.com/dan_p_simpson/) arguing that we shouldn't share all our research code (because [it's bad code, Brent](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/775410014383026176)).
  (Also, the linked [McSweeney's post](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers) for approximately the thousandth time.)
- Part one of this [blog post](https://djnavarro.net/post/paths-in-strange-spaces/) (slash art project) by [Danielle Navarro](https://twitter.com/djnavarro/) arguing that pre-registration is not all its cracked up to be.
- November's [Turing Way newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/the-turing-way-project-is-expanding-to-a-multi-volume-book-series), with the exciting announcement the project will be expanding into a whole *series* of books!
- This short [blog post](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists) by [David Tan](https://twitter.com/davified) reminding us that good coding habits do exist (and that some people actually follow them :open_mouth:).
- [Ariel Rokem's](https://twitter.com/arokem/) write-up of [BrainHack Global: Seattle edition](https://arokem.github.io/rokem-research/2019/10/21/brainhack-global.html) discussing Neuropixels and the need for better big data infrastructure in neuroscience.

### Just for fun

- This absolutely hilarious [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/xoDrVenture/status/1188222250513850373) of [@xoDrVenture](https://twitter.com/xoDrVenture) live-tweeting her first reading of Bram Stoker's "Dracula".
- I was *beyond excited* when I discovered that I can change the touchbar on my computer into a [Tamagotchi](https://twitter.com/gracecondition/status/1196280265821151232).
