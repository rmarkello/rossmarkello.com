It was Thanksgiving in the US so I took the latter half of the week to travel back to the States for some hectic but enjoyable family time.
Driving six hours to Massachusetts and and six hours back in the span of three days means that my reading time was limited (though I did have lots of time for podcasts&mdash;we always listen to [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all) on roadtrips and can't recommend it enough).

Despite the travels, I did manage to get through a few papers, blog posts, and articles that I really enjoyed.
Hopefully you find something that piques your interest, too!

### Preprints and papers

- Distributed coding of choice, action and engagement across the mouse brain ([link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1787-x)) by [Nicholas A. Steinmetz](https://twitter.com/SteinmetzNeuro), [Peter Zatka-Haas](https://twitter.com/peterzh), [Matteo Carandini](https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini), and [Kenneth D. Harris](https://twitter.com/kennethd_harris) (and this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SteinmetzNeuro/status/1199796594649911297?s=20) for the tl;dr)
- Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool ([link](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784)) by [Amelia McNamara](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN) (and her accompanying [blog post](https://www.amelia.mn/blog/papers/2019/11/26/Key-Attributes.html)). I don't 100% agree with all her points, but I think the overall message is important!
